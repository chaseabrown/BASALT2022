# BASALT 2022 - Jupyter Notebooks

## [Item Classifier - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Item Classifier.ipynb>) 

A notebook demonstration of the item classifier in *InvClassifier.py* with an explaination of the process.

**Packages Used: OS, NumPy, PIL, SkLearn, MatPlotLib, CV2**

* [Item Quantity Classifier - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Item Quantity Classifier.ipynb>) is a notebook demonstration of the item quantity classifier in *InvClassifier.py* with an explaination of the process.

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, PIL, SkLearn, MatPlotLib, CV2**

* [Data Generator Class Setup - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Data Generator Class Setup.ipynb>) is a notebook demonstration of how I step up and tested *StartImageGenerator* and *EndImageGenerator*. 

  **Packages Used: NumPy, PIL, Json, TQDM, Pandas, Random, CV2, Math, Keras**

* [Move Classifier Data Exploration - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Move Classifier Data Exploration.ipynb>) is a notebook visualization/exploration of my automatically generated gameplay dataset. This one is fun because it has a lot of pictures and data preprocessing, but this dataset did not end up chosen in the final model.

  **Packages Used: OS, Sys, Json, NumPy, IPython.Display, TQDM, Random**

* [Visualize Model Results (Move Classifier) - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Visualize Model Results (Move Classifier).ipynb>) is a notebook demonstrating the model outputs from *MoveClassifier.py*. 

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotLib, PIL, Json, Random, IPython.display**

* [Dataset Exploration (BASALTAgent Moves) - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Dataset Exploration (BASALTAgent Moves).ipynb>) is a notebook visualization/exploration of BASALT 2022 competition gameplay dataset. This one is fun because it has a lot of pictures and data preprocessing.

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, Pandas, Json, CV2, PIL, IPython.display**
  
* [ColorMap Smoothing - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/ColorMap Smoothing.ipynb>) is a notebook exploration at an attempt to smooth the ColorMap data collected. Concluded to not be a great choice for this project, but the smoothing works and is clearly demonstrated and visualized.

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, Pandas, TQDM, PIL, CV2**
  
* [KNN Grouping to Match Similar Colors in Image - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/KNN Grouping to Match Similar Colors in Image.ipynb>) is a notebook exploration at an attempt to smooth the ColorMap data collected using KNN. Concluded to not be a great choice for this project again, and smoothing was fine, but not great. *ColorMap Smoothing.ipynb* was better.

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, PIL, CV2, TDQM**
  
* [Explore Depth and ColorMaps - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Explore Depth and ColorMaps.ipynb>) is a notebook visualization of a Malmo dataset I generated for training data to feed into *BlockSegmentator.py* and *DepthEstimator.py*. Lots of visuals, tables, and pretty pictures.

  **Packages Used: OS, NumPy, Pandas, PIL, TQDM, IPython.display, Json, Requests, ShUtil**
  
* [TF-IDF with Spark MineWiki Search Engine - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/TF-IDF with Spark MineWiki Search Engine.ipynb>) is a notebook demonstration of how I use TF-IDF to search through the many pages of MineWiki Data distributed by MineDojo. Works really well and uses PySpark for all the data preprocessing, transformation and TF-IDF work which makes it really fast. This is the start of me introducing Natural Language Processing to get more information for my Agent.

  **Packages Used: OS, Pandas, PySpark SQL, PySparkML**

* [Create Search Engine for MineDojo Youtube Dataset - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Create Search Engine for MineDojo Youtube Dataset.ipynb>) is a notebook demonstration of how I use TF-IDF to search through transcripts of 70k gameplay Youtube Videos distributed by MineDojo. After the success on the MineWiki search, I brought that to this problem. Doesn't work great because the words said are not as consistent in a transcript as a Wiki page. It still uses PySpark for all the data preprocessing, transformation and TF-IDF work which makes it really fast. After this I need to look into some other options for gathering information from transcripts.

  **Packages Used: Minedojo, IPython.display, Random, TDQM, OS, RE, Pandas, PySpark SQL, PySparkML**

* [Explore MineDojo Gym Observations and Actions - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Explore MineDojo Gym Observations and Actions.ipynb>) is a notebook visualization of a the MineDojo Gym Environment's Observation and Action set. 

  **Packages Used: Minedojo, NumPy, Random, PIL**
  
* [Explore MineDojo Tasks - FINISHED](<https://github.com/chaseabrown/BASALT2022/blob/master/notebooks/Explore Depth and ColorMaps.ipynb>) is a notebook visualization of a the MineDojo Gym Tasks and Instructions.

  **Packages Used: Minedojo**
